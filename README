cl.ly'd allows users to have custom domain URLs for use with CloudApp for free.

Just upload cllyd.php to any website (rename it to index.php if you dont want to type: example.com/cllyd.php?u=blah)

Just either use the file with a POST method in HTML (as shown in index.html) or just the php file (example.com/cllyd.php?u=endofurlhere)

I wrote this in one night because I was bored.
